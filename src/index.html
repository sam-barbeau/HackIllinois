                Sleep is very important, yet many people do not get enough of it. In fact,
                50% of college students report daytime sleepiness, and 70% report insufficient 
                sleep. The GPAS of students receiving 9+ hours of sleep per night were significantly
                higher (3.24) than those of students receiving 6 or fewer hours of sleep per night (2.74).

                Many athletes, bodybuilders, and those focusing on good nutritional health track protein consumption.
                According to Mayo Clinic The recommended amount of daily protein intake to prevent deficiency for an average 
                adult is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. Use <a href="/Users/sambarbeau/HackIllinois_beginner/src/protein_tracker.html">this</a> 
                tracker to help you track your protein intake throughout the day. Note, if you exercise or if you are above the 
                ages of 40-50 your daily protein needs increase in order to support muscle growth and prevent losing muscle mass.</p>
